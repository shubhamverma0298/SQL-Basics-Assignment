        "**Q 2 Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide\n",
        "examples of common types of constraints?**\n",
        "  - Constraints in a database are rules enforced on the data columns of a table to limit the type of data that can be entered. Their primary purpose is to maintain data integrity, ensuring that the data stored in the database is accurate, consistent, and reliable. By preventing the entry of incorrect, duplicate, or inconsistent data, constraints help uphold business rules and preserve the logical structure and relationships within the database.\n",
        "  Constraints contribute to data integrity by:\n",
        "  - Enforcing Data Validity:They ensure that data conforms to predefined standards and formats, preventing invalid entries.\n",
        "  1. Maintaining Consistency: They guarantee that data across related tables remains consistent, especially when modifications occur.\n",
        "  2. Ensuring Uniqueness: They prevent duplicate entries where uniqueness is required, such as for identifiers.\n",
        "  3. Preserving Relationships:They safeguard the relationships between different tables, ensuring referential integrity.\n",
        "  - Common types of constraints include:\n",
        "  1. PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring no duplicate or null values in the designated column(s).\n",
        "  2. FOREIGN KEY: Establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table, enforcing referential integrity.\n",
        "  3. UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column (or set of columns) are distinct, preventing duplicate entries.\n",
        "  4. NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values, requiring a value for every entry in that column.\n",
        "  5. CHECK: Defines a condition that all values in a column must satisfy, validating data against specific criteria (e.g., age must be greater than 0).\n",
        "  6. DEFAULT: Specifies a default value for a column when no value is explicitly provided during data insertion.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q 3 Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justifyyour answer ?**\n",
        "  - The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that it always contains a value and cannot be left empty or undefined.\n",
        "  - A primary key, on the other hand, cannot contain NULL values; it must be unique and identify each record in a table, and NULL values would violate this uniqueness\n",
        "  - Justification : A Not Null constraint can contain duplicate values but primary key can't contain the duplicate value because of its unique identification feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q 4 Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint?**\n",
        "  - Adding or removing constraints on an existing SQL table involves using the ALTER TABLE command.\n",
        "  -  example :->   \n",
        "      ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
        "\n",
        "      ADD CONSTRAINT UC_EmployeeEmail UNIQUE (Email);\n",

        "\n",
        "        DROP CONSTRAINT UC_EmployeeEmail;\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q 5 Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints.Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint?**\n",
        "  - Attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates database constraints results in the rejection of the operation and the generation of an error message. This mechanism ensures data integrity and consistency within the database. The database management system (DBMS) prevents the operation from completing, effectively rolling back any changes that would lead to an inconsistent state.\n",
        "  - The specific consequences depend on the type of constraint violated:\n",
        "    1. Primary Key Constraint Violation: Attempting to insert a row with a primary key value that already exists, or updating a primary key to a duplicate value, will be rejected.\n",
        "    2. Unique Constraint Violation: Similar to primary keys, inserting or updating a value in a column or set of columns with a unique constraint to a value that already exists in another row will be rejected.\n",
        "  - example : NOT NULL Constraint Violation: Attempting to insert or update a NULL value into a column defined with a NOT NULL constraint will be rejected.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Msg 2627, Level 14, State 1, Line 1\n",

This table has a composite primary key consisting of film_id and actor_id, and it contains no other columns besides these two foreign keys.
